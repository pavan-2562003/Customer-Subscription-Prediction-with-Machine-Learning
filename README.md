# Customer-Subscription-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning



 Introduction:

o The goal of this assignment is to apply the basic concepts of data science to a real-
world problem.

 Data Preparation:
o The first step is to load the dataset into a data frame.
o You will need to clean the data by removing missing values and outliers.
o You may also need to transform some of the data, such as converting categorical
variables to numerical values.


 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o Once the data is clean, you can start exploring it.
o This involves creating visualizations and performing statistical analyses to
understand the data.


 Model Building:
o Once you have a good understanding of the data, you can start building a model to
predict subscription.
o There are many different machine learning algorithms that you can use.

o Some of the most common algorithms for classification problems (like predicting
subscription) include logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

 Model Evaluation:
o Once you have built a model, you need to evaluate its performance.
o This involves using a holdout dataset to test the model on unseen data.
o You can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate the model's
performance.
 Conclusion:
o In the conclusion, you should summarize your findings and discuss the limitations of
your work.
o You should also discuss the implications of your findings for the real-world problem.
